# Releases
The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/linuxmuster/linuxmuster-linbo-gui/releases/latest)  
The attached file `linuxmuster-linbo-gui7_*.deb` is the Package which you can install on your server.
Please note: the prebuilt packages do not contain a 32-bit version.

# Building yourself
For your convenience there is a script to build the package: [build.sh](./build.sh)  
You have to invoke it in the build root.  
If you want to build the 32-bit version, you will have to insert `32` in the following places:
- In the file `/build.sh`: Line 64 change `(64)` to `(64 32)`
- In the file `/debian/mkarchives.sh`: Line 24 change `for bits in 64; do` to `for bits in 32 64; do`
Please note: It will take a long time to build the first time you do it.  

# Screenshots
Some screenshots can be found here: https://github.com/linuxmuster/linuxmuster-linbo-gui/tree/master/.github/media  
Please note that they might not be up to date though.
  
# Icons
All of the SVG icons in this Gui were taken from one of the following sources and slighlty modified:
- The Linux Mint was taken from [Icon Fonts](http://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon) and is licensed by CC BY 3.0
- The Debian icon was taken from [debian.org](https://www.debian.org/logos/)
- The Windows 7 icon was taken from [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windows_logo_-_2002%E2%80%932012_(Black).svg)
- All other icons were taken from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/license) and are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://fontawesome.com/license).

# Creating a release
The following steps have to be followed to create a release:
1. Update the changelog file
2. Update the version code in the .pro file
3. commit all changes
4. Do a git push: `git push`
5. Wait for translations sync pipeline
  - if it pushes new changes, do a git pull: `git pull`
6. Create a git tag in the format v+VERSION (eg. v7.0.0): `git tag vVERSION`
7. Push tags: `git push --tags`

In case of a mistake, the tag can be deleted:
1. Locally: `git tag -d vVERSION`
2. Remotely: `git push --delete origin vVERSION`

## Version schema:
- Genreal: `major.minor.patch` ([semver](https://semver.org/))
- Prereleases (release candidates) must end with `~XX` where `XX` is the number of the Prerelease
  - So, before version `7.1.1` is released, there may be versions `7.1.1~01`, `7.1.1~02`, and so on
- Releases don't have a suffix
  - So, once version `7.1.1` is ready, it is published as `7.1.1`
- This concept ensures that stable releases are elays evaluated as a higher version Number than perreleases.
